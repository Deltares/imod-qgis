about=  This plugin aids exploring 4D geospatial data and links to the iMOD 3D viewer.
        It is part of a larger software suite, named "iMOD Suite" (see homepage). 
        Mesh data can be used to store data with a time, z, y, and x dimension. 
        Currently the z-dimension is only scarcely supported by MDAL. 
        Therefore, for each vertical layer, we require a mesh dataset with the
        following variables:

        - "{var}_layer_{nr}"
        - "top_layer_{nr}"
        - "bottom_layer_{nr}" 

        To prepare your datasets for the iMOD QGIS plugin, [we advice using this utility
        function in iMOD
        Python](https://deltares.github.io/imod-python/api/generated/util/imod.util.mdal_compliant_ugrid2d.html#imod.util.mdal_compliant_ugrid2d).
        If you'd like to prepare data yourself for the plugin, [follow this
        example.](https://deltares.github.io/iMOD-Documentation/tutorial_wq.html#convert-output-data).
        We expect to make this less specific in the future.

                - GEF Reader: Added reader for .gef files, to read CPTs
                - Cross-section: Support for drawing CPTs
                - Cross-section: Automatically set mesh without layer data as line
                - Cross-section: Raise clear error message if no top or bottom are provided to mesh with layer data
