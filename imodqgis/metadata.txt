about=  This plugin aids exploring 4D geospatial data and links to the iMOD 3D viewer.
        It is part of a larger software suite, named "iMOD Suite" (see homepage). 
        Mesh data can be used to store data with a time, z, y, and x dimension. 
        Currently the z-dimension is only scarcely supported by MDAL, 
        so instead for each vertical layer, we require a mesh dataset with "{var}_layer_{nr}", 
        "top_layer_{nr}", and "bottom_layer_{nr}" as variables.
        An example of preparing such a dataset is here: 
        https://deltares.github.io/iMOD-Documentation/workflow_wq.html#convert-output-data 
        We expect to improve this in the future.
