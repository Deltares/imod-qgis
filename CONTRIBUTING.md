Useful links 
============

The PyQt5 and PyQgis documentation is quite scattered, and often we have to
resort to reading the C++ API or calling ``dir()``. Here is a list of useful
links which provide some information or examples on how to do things. Below are
some useful links that helped us develop the plugin and its' test bench.

PyQgis
