# iMOD-QGIS plugin

The iMOD plugin extends QGIS functionalities to assist with groundwater modeling.

Primary (planned!) components are:

* Connecting to 3D viewer
* netCDF manager to deal with non-XY dimensions, possibly point data
* Timseries visualization
* Cross-section visualization (see: https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-crayfish-plugin)
